//Keep track of its current value.
//Have a maximum value.
//Calculate the ratio between the current value and max value and convert it

//Update the DOM element with an appropriate value so that it is visible to
//the user.
//Declaring an empty scope property ensures that a new scope will exist
//solely for the directive (referred to as isolate-scope). An isolate-scope
//allows us to bind functions from the directive's view to its scope.

//The link function is automatically generated and scoped to the element
//defining the directive. Think of it as a function that executes when the
//directive is instantiated in the view. This is where all logic related to
//DOM manipulation will go.

//Directive link functions take the same arguments (with a strict order)
//during declaration. Altering the order of these arguments will cause errors.

//The link method's first argument is its scope object. Attributes and methods
// on the scope object are accessible within the directive's view.
//The second argument is the jqLite-wrapped element that the directive matches.
//The third argument is a hash of attributes with which the directive was
// declared. If we declare <seek-bar> with no attributes in the HTML, then
//this hash will be empty.
