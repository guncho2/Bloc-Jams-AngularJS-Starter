//callback function (in this case, seekBar) is a factory function.
//It returns an object that describes the directive's behavior to
// Angular's HTML compiler. This object communicates the behavior
// through options

//templateUrl	Specifies a URL from which the directive will load a
// template.
//replace	Specifies what the template should replace. If true, the
//template replaces the directive's element. If false, the template
//replaces the contents of the directive's element.
//restrict	Restricts the directive to a specific declaration
//style: element  E, attribute A, class C, and comment M. If omitted,
//the defaults (E and A) are used. Multiple restrictions are stringed
//together, for example AE or AEC.
// We've named the directive seekBar, which means Angular will look for seek-bar
//in the HTML and call this directive when it finds that markup.

//restrict: 'E' instructs Angular to treat this directive as an element.
//For example, Angular will run the code if it finds <seek-bar> in
//the HTML, but not if it finds  <div seek-bar>.

//replace: true instructs Angular to completely replace the <seek-bar>
// element with the directive's HTML template rather than insert the
// HTML between the  <seek-bar></seek-bar> tags.

//The templateUrl option specifies the path to the HTML template that
//the directive will use. We've added a template URL, but we haven't yet
// made the template. Let's do that now.




//Declaring an empty scope property ensures that a new scope will exist
//solely for the directive (referred to as isolate-scope). An isolate-scope
//allows us to bind functions from the directive's view to its scope.

//The link function is automatically generated and scoped to the element
//defining the directive. Think of it as a function that executes when the
//directive is instantiated in the view. This is where all logic related to
//DOM manipulation will go.

//Directive link functions take the same arguments (with a strict order)
//during declaration. Altering the order of these arguments will cause errors.

//The link method's first argument is its scope object. Attributes and methods
// on the scope object are accessible within the directive's view.
//The second argument is the jqLite-wrapped element that the directive matches.
//The third argument is a hash of attributes with which the directive was
// declared. If we declare <seek-bar> with no attributes in the HTML, then
//this hash will be empty.

//seekBar's HTML template can access the attributes and methods of the
//directive's  scope object â€“ in this case: scope.value, scope.max, and
//scope.fillStyle
//scope.value	Holds the value of the seek bar, such as the currently playing
//song time or the current volume. Default value is 0.
//scope.max	Holds the maximum value of the song and volume seek bars. Default value is 100.
//percentString()	A function that calculates a percent based on the value and
 //maximum value of a seek bar.
//scope.fillStyle()	Returns the width of the seek bar fill element based on
//the calculated percent.
