 <!--we want to specify an external function that the directive will call when the
 seek bar position changes. In doing so, the directive can remain a general
 visualization that supports a broad set of use cases.
Add an attribute named on-change that takes an expression to execute when we change
the value of the seek bar. In this case, we'll pass it a callback that sets the time
 of the song to correspond to the value of the seek bar

 time of the song code:
 var seek = function(time) {

        currentSoundFile.setTime(time);

                in scope.value as the value that is the argument for this function, but the two are

 <!-- The code looks good! One thing I noticed is this line in player_bar.html:
max="{{ playerBar.songPlayer.currentSong.volume(100) }}"
That code assumes there is a volume function on the currentSong object, which we don't
have. In this case, since the max value will never change you can just set it directly:
max="100"If we expected to change that value for some reason programmatically we could
 add a property to SongPlayer, like SongPlayer.maxVolume = 100; and then add a
 function to modify that, but I don't see a reason for that. -->
