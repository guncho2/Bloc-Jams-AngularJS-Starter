album	Refers to the controller. We use "controller as" syntax:  AlbumCtrl as album in our config block in app.js
.songPlayer	A property on the album object:  this.songPlayer = SongPlayer;, where this refers to the controller.
.play(song)	A method returned by the SongPlayer service, which we've injected and made available to AlbumCtrl.-->
